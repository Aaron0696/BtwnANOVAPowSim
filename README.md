#### Between-subjects ANOVA Power Simulator
> Implementing a simulation-approach to calculating power in R Shiny.

### Introduction
This is a personal project to consoliate and apply my knowledge in making R Shiny apps.

### Power
Power is a concept that was taught in my first statistical course in Psychology. However, I felt that it did not receive its deserved attention during my undergraduate and graduate years in NUS. Few would conduct apriori power analysis while some might occasionally conduct post-hoc power analysis to justify why their experiment did not produce statistically significant results. From my personal experience, some reasons that contribute to this phenomenon are:

* Low stakes of projects (most experiments were simply used to attain a grade for a percentage of a course).
* Power-determinism, I came up with this term myself and it refers to the cognition that sample size is the only determinant of power that the experimenter has power over. So power is ignored with the heuristic: "Just collect as many subjects as possble."
* Not knowing how to calculate power.
